    Fix the issue that arises when a default access modifier should be protected.

    Steps:

    1. Create a package named animals.

    2. Inside the animals package, create a class named Animal.

    3. Inside the Animal class, create a field named species with the default access modifier.

    4. Create another package named main. Put this on the same level as the animals package.

    5. In the main package, create a class named Dog that extends Animal in the same package.

    6. In the Dog class, add a method printSpecies that displays the value of the species. Ignore the red squiggly line for now.

    7. Inside the main package, create a class named Main.

    8. In the main method of the Main class, create an instance of the Dog class and call the printSpecies method.

    9. Fix the issue by changing the access modifier of the species field to protected.

    10. Was there another way to fix the issue?
